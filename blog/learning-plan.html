        <h1>My Learning Plan</h1>


        <h3 style="font-family: Roboto; font-size: 35px; text-align: center; margin-top: 60px;">Career Goals</h3>
    
    <div class="careergoals">
            <p>  
             </p>

             <p>I'm not an expert in anything. I don't have a 'craft'. I know lots of things about lots of things, but I aspire to know a trade deeply and keep learning. My goal in this journey into web development is to get to a level where I can confidently produce work to a standard which surpasses the expectations of my employer. Ultimately, I'd like to have some input into the look and feel of a site, so perhaps I'm leaning towards front-end development. </p>

    <h3 style="font-family: Roboto; font-size: 35px; text-align: center; margin-top:-30px;">Limitations</h3>
    
    <div class="limitations">
            <p>When it comes to learning, I've noticed a pattern where I will understand concepts very well, but in practise, I stumble and doubt that I am doing the right thing after all. I'm a perfectionist, which for me means I read too much into the detail, then spend an unforgivable amount of time working on the output. </p>
        </div>

    <h3 style="font-family: Roboto; font-size: 35px; text-align: center; margin-top:-70px;">Core Skills</h3>
    
        <div class="core">
                <p>I am disproportionately self-critical. Building up confidence in my abilities to learn and produce good work would be very helpful. I have a very open mind, so learning techniques to engage in any help to tackle this longstanding attribute of mine are very welcome. </p>
            </div>
    
            <h3 style="font-family: Roboto; font-size: 35px; text-align: center; margin-top:-70px;">Managing Workload</h3>
    
            <div class="workload">
                    <p>I'm in the early stages of the course, and I've already lost the battle with the timebox. I have no other commitments, so I'm treating my journey with Dev Academy like a full-time job. Using Toggl and Pomadoro, I have managed to sync myself into a positive working environment where I can focus, but also appreciate the need to stretch and look outside. If I can master my perfectionism and need to spend longer than required on a task, I will be more efficient and confident that what I produce is at the level required during the course.   </p>
                <p>With doubts, come questions, and I have submitted many of those in the Discord threads. I am not afraid to ask for help from the Dev Community and will continue to do so throughout my learnings.</p>

                  <h3 style="font-family: Roboto; font-size: 35px; text-align: center; margin-top:120px;">Expectations </h3>
    
            <div class="expectations">
                    <p>I have none! But in the context of any guidance I will receive during my journey, my only request is that there is honesty, engagement, and constructive feedback on how I'm progressing.  </p>
