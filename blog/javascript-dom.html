  <h1>JavaScript Fundamentals</h1>


  <div class="JavaIntro">
   <p>Think of any party you’ve hosted. First you come up with a theme or reason to have it. Then you organise a venue and whatever drinks/food you want. You’ll then decorate the venue using colours and theme-related designs. Then your guests arrive, and the party begins. The music plays, there’s dancing, there could also be some fancy disco lights. That’s JavaScript. The party itself is JavaScript.</p>
    </div>

       
    <h3 style="font-family: Roboto; font-size: 30px; text-align: center; margin-top: 30px ">What is Control Flow & Looping?</h3>

    <div class="ControlLoop">
    <p> In JavaScript, control flow describes the sequence of events for any given task. For example </p>

    <p>Imagine you want some toast and peanut butter.</p>
    <p>First you locate a plate </p> 
    <p>Then you locate a knife</p>
    <p>Then you locate the peanut butter</p>
    <p>Then you locate the bread</p>
    <p>Then put the bread in the toaster</p>
    <p>Then you switch on the toaster and the toaster will toast the bread</p>
    <p>Then you remove the toast from the toaster</p>
    <p>Then you put your toast on your plate</p>
    <p>Then you use your knife to spread peanut butter on your toast.</p>
    <p>You want more toast? You simply follow the instructions again. The whole point of looping is to repeat something that is happening. The whole point of looping is to repeat something that is happening. The whole point of looping is to repeat something that is happening.....</p>
      
    <h3 style="font-family: Roboto; font-size: 30px; text-align: center; margin-top: 30px ">The DOM</h3>

    <div class="theDOM">
    <p> The Document Object Model (DOM) is a portal into the contents of a webpage. When your browser loads a webpage, you are greeted with a display of text, colours, and images amongst other things. In JavaScript language, a webpage is known as a ‘document’, and everything displayed on the document is an object. Those objects are based on HTML and CSS elements and styles, which can be manipulated via the DOM. For example, if you wanted to change some text on your webpage, you can do it using the DOM which can be accessed via the webpage itself using developer tools (DevTools).....more..</p>
    </div>

    <h3 style="font-family: Roboto; font-size: 30px; text-align: center; margin-top: 30px ">Accessing Arrays & Objects</h3>

    <div class="arraysObj">
    <p>Accessing objects vs arrays take two very different paths, for example:</p>

    <p>  Objects can be defined as a ‘thing’ and consist of a key value e.g., ‘car’. When you want to access an object, you request access to that particular key value i.e. ‘car’.</p>
      
      
     <p> Arrays are different in that they are a collection of ordered values where a value is assigned to a number depending on its place in the index e.g., red = 0, blue =1, green =2. When you want to access data from a array, you used the stored value, in e.g if I wanted 'blue' I would request [1] </p>

    <h3 style="font-family: Roboto; font-size: 30px; text-align: center; margin-top: 30px ">Functions</h3>
    <p>In the code of a typical webpage, there are numerous functions. Functions can be particularly helpful because they are reusable and readily access a block of code that performs a defined task.</p>
<p>There are two stages to making a function execute a task, they are ‘defining’ and ‘calling’. First, you need to ‘define’ what you would like the function to do. For example, if you would like to greet someone, you might define the function as ‘greet’ and create as many responses as you like. However, it isn’t until you ‘call’ the function that the response will be accessed and executed.</p>
