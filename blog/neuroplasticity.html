    <h1>Neuroplasticity & Growth Mindsets</h1>

    <h3>Neuroplasticity</h3>


    <p>
       I got my van stuck in mud today. The more I tried to drive out of the mud, the deeper the tread, and the more stuck I
       got. Again and again, the tread got deeper the more my tyres spun hopelessly in the mud. I got out eventually.
   </p>
 
    <p>
        It reminded me of how neuroplasticity works. Our brains are filled with a series of pathways, and every time we think in a
        certain way, do or feel something in a certain way, we are strengthening our pathways. We're deepening our tread. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Sadly, there is a belief that we're hardwired and fixed as we become adults. Years of thinking and doing and feeling in
      a certain way creates the false belief that we can't change our mindset.That we are in effect 'stuck'. However,
      neuroplasticity shows that when we are learning, we are developing new pathways. The first time we doing something new,
      it takes time and can consume a lot of energy. However, with practise, repetition, and a belief that you can become
      unstuck, it is possible to create new pathways which will become stronger and eventually more automated. 
    </p>

    <p>
      By recognising patterns in your behaviour, it is possible to learn how to change them if you want to. Forming new habits
      will help to teach the mind to be more agile. With practise and persistence, you could learn anything. This TedTalk by Dr Hannah Critchlow simplifies how our "brain is our organ of destiny".

    <h3>Growth Mindset</h3>
    <p> 
      In the same vain as neuroplasticity, having a 'growth mindset' can also be hugely beneficial. 
    </p>

    <p>
      The term 'growth mindset' is exactly what it is - being open to growing and developing your thoughts. It is a way of thinking that encourages you to view life as a journey for continual improvement. It opens opportunities for learning without fear of criticism from yourself or others, and views challenges as building blocks to self improvement. 
    </p>
 
    <p>
     The opposite of course is having a 'fixed mindset', which offers a very static way of thought and interacting with the world,
     where challenges become obstacles and failure is inevitable. Learning is pointless, the easy route appeals more. Here's a short video that explains the differences <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nF90sAW-Yg">Mindset by Dr Carol Dweck</a>
    </p>

    <p>
      Thinking about my learning journey at Dev Academy, I can already feel a shift in my mindset. I started knowing nothing at all about coding, what it is or what it does. I just knew that it appealed to me to learn something completely out of my comfort zone, which quite frankly, was beginning to bore me. 
    </p>

    <p>
      During times of frustration at the pace at which I'm learning, and my perception that others are learning faster than
      me, I remind myself that a growth mindset will see me through the challenges. Having that self-awareness and with
      practise, I should have a less bumpy ride moving forward.
