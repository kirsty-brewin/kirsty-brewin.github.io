    <h1>Problem Solving</h1>

    <p>
    One thing I've learned about my Web Developer journey, is that it is problematic. Not in the sense that the role is
    problematic, but that it throws a constant barrage of problems your way. Lucky for me, I'm like a dog with a bone when
    it comes to problem solving. Though unluckily, the barrage of bones can be overwhelming at times. Here's how I've got
    through some of them.
    </p>
    
    <h3>The problem with blockages</h3>

    <p> 
      If there was a decongestant out there that could help with my spiralling JavaScript blockages, I'd happily take it. The simplest problems are my worst enemies. I get cocky, then blindsided. 
    </p>

    <p>
       By week three of my Dev journey, I had reached a point where writing code was becoming a familiar exercise, and with practise, it was getting easier. However, I still haven't mastered the art of the curly brackets '{ }'. On numerous occasions I have sweated and strained to complete given tasks, and just when I've thought I've cracked it, those curlies trip me up.
    </p>

    <p>
      I usually reach out to my friend Google and check and re-check what I had already gleaned from it. I try explaining my code story to the dog, but he loses interest pretty quickly. Then I reach out to my peers on Discord, the all seeing and knowing online safe space, only to be told the curlies had got me again.   
    </p>

    <p>
      I think moving forward, I need to remember that if the code isnâ€™t working, there will always be a reason and a solution somewhere. Take a break. Make a cuppa. Check the curlies.
    </p>

    <h3>Elegant problem solving</h3>
    
      <p> Is there such a thing? When I think of how I've solved most of my code problems, I wouldn't describe my techniques as elegant. More that of a newborn horse trying to find his balance on polished wood flooring.
      </p>

      <p>
        At this point, I honestly can't think of a problem solving situation where my techniques haven't also included some kicking and screaming. I'm still working on this.
      </p>
    

    <h3>Problem solving techniques</h3>

      <p>
        As the old saying goes, "there is more than one way to skin a cat". Here's my take on how certain techniques help me in a crisis:
      </p>


      <h2>Pseudocode</h2>

      <p> This technique is relatively new to me, so it's still early days. So far it has helped me to better map out the steps of how I need to go about writing code while in the coding window.
      </p>


      <h2>Trying something</h2>

      <p> This one gets my stamp of approval, however, I need to learn when to stop trying things and instead ask for help. Another work in progress.
      </p>
    
      <h2>Rubber Ducky</h2>

      <p> As alluded to earlier in my blog, the dog is the recipient of most of my rants. Helps occassionally.
      </p>

      <h2>Reading error messages</h2>

      <p> I need more practise at this. The more I get familiar with some of the terminology, the more I'll understand why it's shouting at me.
      </p>
    
      <h2>Console logging</h2>
      
      <p> This technique eluded me for a long time, but I finally 'get it' and it's usefulness. 
      </p>

      <h2>Googling</h2>
      
      <p>While I use Google as my go-to for most code problems, I do spend a lot of time disappointed in its results. I'm often stuck trying to figure out how others' workings relate to my code problem. Again, this should get better when I become more confident in code speak.
      </p>

      <h2>Asking real life people for help</h2>
      
      <p>Along with Googling, which despite my complaints, still helps explain things an awful lot, asking my lovely peers and helpful Dev staff is my favourite technique. Not only do I get personalised help, but there's comfort in knowing that I'm not the only one who is having a silly moment.
      </p>

      <h2>The value in reflection</h2>
      
      <p>Reflection and blog writing allows me to shed much needed light on my learning journey. For me it's a reminder to myself that my outlook on aspects of my learning style aren't fixed. I can already see how far I've come.      </p>
