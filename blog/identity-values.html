    <div class="who">
      <p> Kia ora from Wellington! I'm Kirsty, a Yorkshire lass with a deep appreciation of chuckling at the absurdity
        of everyday life. I've lived over here for nearly 17 years, and despite some hankering to return to Northern
        England, I call Wellington my home.
        I came here as a backpacker. I had always wanted to live abroad, but I never thought I'd be
        so far away from my roots.
      </p>

      <p> I started life wanting to be an Olympic runner, then a police officer, then a typographist, then a sound
        engineer, then a.. well, the list goes on. In 'grown-up' life I have studied/worked in web content management,
        conservation biology, written comms, project management, policy, natural resource stewardship and bicycle
        mechanics. If you asked me now what I'd like to be when I grow up, I'd say whatever challenges me and makes me
        happy.

    <h3 class="identity">Identity & Values</h3>

    <div>
      <p> I was brought up by my Jewish mother in a Jewish community in Leeds. Growing up, being Jewish was a huge part of
        my life. All of my friends were Jewish. I observed all of the Jewish holidays by fasting, dinners, not hanging
        my washing out on a Saturday (the toughest rule to observe). When I left the community I grew up in, and my
        older relatives passed, the baton to carry on following traditions was dropped. While I feel richly enhanced by
        the learnings and amazing friendships and connections I made growing up in the community, I came to realise that
        maybe it was less about belief and more about community. Needless to say, the community wouldn't have
        existed unless we shared the common belief, so for that, I'm grateful.
      </p>
      <p> When it comes to my values and identity today, I think it has played a huge part in my sense of wanting to
        belong, others to belong, and wanting to nurture myself and others. How I care deeply about social dynamics and
        the impact people can make within social groups and to everything around them. While I no longer identify myself
        as Jewish, I do still have incredible respect for anyone who chooses to adopt positive influences to shape their
        world and carry them through life. That sense of contributing to, and belonging, whether it's to a family,
        social group, team project or religion, is incredibly powerful and rewarding.
      </p>

    <h3 class="webdev">Could I be a Web Developer?</h3>

    <div>
      <p>Excellent question! Can I phone a friend? I think my strengths will get on reeaally well with those needed to
        succeed as a developer. Take problem solving. I am known for my ridiculous ability to fix any washing machine. I
        have no idea why my talent is fixed to that particular genre of machinery, but there it is. Another is
        perseverance. Have you seen the Terminator? Enough said.
      </p>

      <p>But enough about those strengths that will serve me well infront of a coding screen, what about human
        interaction? That's were my strengths like to really soar. I readily enjoy and invite communication of all
        kinds. Written, verbal, creative (samba percussion anyone?). I've given up winking.
      </p>

      <p>So, armed with a smorgasboard of strengths, I probably should look at a career doing TedTalks on washing
        machine malfunctions, but I'll see how I go with Web Development first.
