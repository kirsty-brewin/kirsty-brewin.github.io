     <h1>Emotional Intelligence (EQ)</h1>
              
   <div>
    
    <p> Emotional intelligence is when you utilise self-awareness of your thoughts and behaviours.  Practising techniques like mindfulness and self-observation requires disciplined attention, but the reward is that you become better attuned with yourself, making for a more balanced emotional state.</p>
   
            
            
            
           <h3>How is it different to Intelligence (IQ?)</h3> 
            <p>There is a difference between the two. A persons' IQ relates to 'what they know' and the information they have retained through learning. A persons' EQ is how a person is actively engaged with their thoughts and feelings, and how it influences their behaviour.</p>
            
            
            <h3> Why is it important</h3>
          <p>Having self-awareness gifts you the ability to better understand how you interact with the world, and how you present yourself to others. It also looks after you, by making you a more balanced version of yourself.  </p>
