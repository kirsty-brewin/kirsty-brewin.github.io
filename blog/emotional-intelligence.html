           <p> I get so emotional 
            </p>

            <p> When it comes to my values and identity today, I think it has played a huge part in my sense of wanting to belong, others to belong, and wanting to nurture myself and others. How I care deeply about social dynamics and the impact people can make within social groups and to everything around them. While I no longer identify myself as Jewish, I do still have incredible respect for anyone who chooses to adopt positive influences to shape their world and carry them through life. That sense of contributing to, and belonging, whether it's to a family, social group, team project or religion, is incredibly powerful and rewarding.</p>
